                        <p>ICO - Utility Token, Sunset Watt Tokens - SWT, related to 08 Renewable Energy Power Plant. In
                            our
                            projections we have considered the solar panels and equipment's degradation rate to have the
                            best estimated energy production as possible</p>
                        <p>We aim to offer the utility token, Sunset Watt Token – SWT, as an innovative and modern way
                            to
                            finance green energy projects, to generate and distribute renewable energy, to remove
                            investment
                            barriers allowing access from investors anytime, anywhere in worldwide. We have everything
                            ready
                            to start from Brazil, beside that, and after well consolidated our new model our main idea
                            is to
                            expanding inland and off-grid areas in Brazil, on that promising unexplored market, before
                            expanding to other emerging countries.</p>
                        <p>The main core of the business is to manage funds to install 41 MW of Renewable Energy (07
                            Solar
                            Power Plant and 01 Mixed Solar & Wind Power Plant), 02 Green Hydrogen Plant (with a
                            production
                            capacity of up to 250,000 kg / year of green H2 each), 02 Datacenters. Those utility tokens,
                            SWT, once listed on an exchange they will be used to finance the green energy production.
                            Investors will have returns as soon as the renewable energy gets delivered, and the tokens
                            can
                            be withdrawn or transferred to another investor or even to the end buyer of our energy to be
                            used as a payment for the energy consumed.</p>
                        <p>We can use our own exchanging platform to settle the utility tokens, SWT, together with the
                            end
                            buyers and utilize the exchange to negotiate the utility token on the market
                            (buy/sell/transfer), our Sunset Capital Platform can serve as a settlement layer when
                            investors
                            want to use the Sunset Watt Tokens.</p>
                        <h2 class="light_green small">Blockchain, Ethereum, and Smart Contracts</h2>
                        <p>With the proprietary smart contract capacity of the Ethereum blockchain, it will suffice to
                            build
                            the Sunset Capital Blockchain as a layer on the Ethereum platform. Why a subsequent Mainnet
                            deployment can result in the medium term, it is a market fact that several projects launched
                            on
                            Ethereum platform have grown to become global market leaders.</p>
                        <p>For smart contract functionality, using the Ethereum platform will be a starting point that
                            is
                            worth highlighting. With smart contracts in their functionality clearly self-executing, they
                            provide a transparent basis for renewable energy administration that all parties to the
                            transaction will be comfortable with.</p>
                        <p>Regulatory agencies will be able to observe power generation and distribution trails in order
                            to
                            carry out their oversight functions. The Sunset utility tokens global investors will be also
                            able to view their transaction history without avoidable bottlenecks that act against the
                            goals
                            of energy democratization.</p>
                        <p>Token sale and the Sunset Capital Blockchain Platform development will take place on the
                            Ethereum
                            Platform. We have chosen Ethereum for its popularity, functionality and security
                            capabilities.
                            However, the expected scale of Sunset Capital’s platform, according to the number of our
                            potential users, represents tens of thousands of consumers, investors, and millions of
                            transactions. This level of load currently can be handled by Ethereum.</p>
                        <p>We believe in the continuous development of Ethereum with Vitalik Buterin already having
                            announced new promising features in Ethereum's upcoming versions. These features will
                            address
                            many of the present issues with the blockchain. At the same time, we are continuing our
                            platform
                            development, based on Ethereum. In the event of Sunset Capital outgrowing Ethereum's
                            capabilities’ limit (presumably it can happen in a one-year period), we can decide to switch
                            to
                            another blockchain, which will be able to meet the needs of the project. Blockchain
                            technologies
                            are developing rapidly, and there are already some promising alternatives. In case of
                            blockchain
                            platform change, all Ethereum tokens will be migrated. Token quantity and conditions for
                            holders
                            will remain unchanged.</p>
                        <h2 class="light_green small">Smart Contracts</h2>
                        <p>The range of use of smart contracts will embody the terms of renewable energy sale to Sunset
                            global investors. Each consumer will be able to view the terms of the contract before
                            signing
                            and be able to see all data related to the green energy power plant generation and prices
                            related to energy production.</p>
                        <p>Smart contracts have shown their efficiency in use by several projects in banking, inventory
                            distribution and management as well as multieholder scenarios.</p>
                        <h2 class="light_green small">Land Registry</h2>
                        <p>There is a requirement for land acquisition in order to be able to install a green energy
                            power
                            plant of a considerable size. With a landmass of 8.5-million-kilometer square, Brazil offers
                            enough space for the development of a worthwhile green power generating project. With
                            completed
                            initial work on land scouting, acquiring the needed land for the project will not pose any
                            challenges.</p>
                        <p>The charges associated with land acquisition include the purchase price, registry fees as
                            well
                            the cost of notary services. Land acquisition is relatively affordable in Brazil, which
                            makes it
                            a good incentive for green energy projects.</p>
                        <p>It's important to mention that grid connection, logistics, consumers, energy availability,
                            weather conditions and specially taxes are different across states and areas in Brazil.</p>
                        <p>Our internal policies will make it mandatory to acquire Land for a long-term project of this
                            size. We have evaluated the pros and cons and are confident in the supporting data that this
                            renewable energy project development is a stable long-term investment.</p>
                        <h2 class="light_green small">Licenses & Permits</h2>
                        <p>Sunset Capital will hold all required licensing and permits pertaining to the acquisition for
                            the
                            renewable energy power plants. All licensing and permits require the development of a
                            workable
                            business plan and proof of funding, which are duly provided for in the terms that underlie
                            this
                            whitepaper.</p>
                        <p>According the implementation schedule we will provide Licenses and Permits as:</p>
                        <p>- Environmental Permits (LP, LI, LO); </p>
                        <p>- Generality Permits </p>
                        <p>- Municipality Permits </p>
                        <p>- Grid Connection Permits </p>
                        <p>- ANEEL Agency Permit</p>
                        <h2 class="light_green small">Audits & Compliance</h2>
                        <p>The crucial roles of audit and compliance cannot be overlooked. An audit of proposed
                            capacity,
                            underlying technology and target infrastructure is a vital component of the business
                            proposition. The Sunset Capital Green Energy Project is driven by a commitment to excellence
                            which has to run through the power generating backbone as well as distribution and customer
                            interface.</p>
                        <p>Local regulations also have a role to play in every project, and we have a rulebook to
                            follow,
                            which highlights the best of global accepted practices and guidelines. Compliance with
                            hardware
                            specification, distribution templates and specified reports at defined intervals necessitate
                            a
                            need to certify manpower requirements, scope of processes and third-party verifications.</p>
